# Frog-Species-Discovery
A frog species distribution project 


A species distribution model is a specific type of machine learning model that aims to predict the distribution of a biological species across geographic space and time. Such models have become increasingly important in conservation efforts globally to better understand and map the habitats of species of interest, particularly threatened or endangered species.

The frog species identified for this challenge is Litoria fallax, the eastern dwarf tree frog. In addition to assisting our understanding of this specific frog species, a successful frog SDM will have broader implications in quantifying biodiversity. This is because frogs are incredibly sensitive to environmental changes, so any changes in their species distribution may indicate an underlying change to biodiversity in the area.
